# Contractsystem for sales and other things
NOTE: The contract system I created mostly on my own for my previous employer (I have written constent which allow me to publish this project, since it's also not in use anymore)

This is a contract system that I have been working on simultaneously with other work reponseabilities. This is also my first big project and was only worked on when i had little to do or if there was a huge bug or feature that was going to added/fixed

It was actively used for about 1 and half years.

The code is mostly written by me but with some help from AI, but I always verifed the code before it went to production and I also did most of the debugging by myself. Also a bit of note to this is that there some dev things that were include with prod and that was because it was only meant as a internal program/system.

There is also alot of weird decisions by me in this project, but hey it worked and that makes me happy :)

*All commits are by me, pictures is just meant show how much work went in to the project. Since there is a certain pride in this being my first big project and I'm honoured to show it off.
